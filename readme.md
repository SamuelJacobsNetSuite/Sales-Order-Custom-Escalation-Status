<h1>NetSuite Sales Order Custom Escalation Status</h1>
<p>This is an account customisation project built using the SuiteCloud Development Framework that allows users in your NetSuite environment to raise issues on Sales Orders. The system logs the user who raises the issue, the timestamp, and a short memo, and displays the information prominently at the top of the Sales Order form.</p>
